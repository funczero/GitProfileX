# Customization Guide

GitProfileX is modular. You can enable or disable sections easily.

---

## Editing Sections

Each template contains blocks:

- Header
- About
- Tech Stack
- Stats
- Projects
- Contact

You can remove any section safely.

---

## Changing Theme

Most stats providers allow themes.

Example:

```
&theme=radical
&theme=tokyonight
&theme=github_dark
```

Modify inside the image URL.

## Editing Badges

Badges are powered by Shields.io.

You can customize:

- Color
- Style
- Logo
- Label

Example:

```
https://img.shields.io/badge/-Node.js-339933?logo=node.js&style=for-the-badge
```
